# mui.picker.js--simplified-version--
Simplified mui to keep only mui.picker components necessary method, function is not missing
Through WeChat small program development, realize that there is no mature picker class script library.Although mui provides a relatively mature picker script library, due to the introduction of mui.js, many methods of mui script library are not applied to picker components.Therefore, I deleted the redundant methods based on the original mui.js, and the code volume was reduced by 4/5.It is used in the same way as the current mui.picker.js.
